Allow you to augment or decorate Composables. It lets you do these  sorts of things: <br>
  1. Change the composable size, layout, shape, layout, behavior and appearance. <br>
  2. Add information like accessibility labels. <br>
  3. Process user input. <br>
  4. Add high-level interactions, like making an element clickable, scrollable, draggable, or zoomable. <br>

* Order of Compose functions matters. <br> <br>

If you want to access colors from resources in Jetpack Compose without declaring variables for each color, <br>
you can do so by using the colorResource function directly in your Composable functions. <br>
_color = colorResource(id = R.color.black)_
